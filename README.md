# KaaRMS

A software application that is used to manage the rental
of properties, such as apartments, houses, vacation rentals, or
equipment. It is typically used by property owners or property
management companies to list and advertise available rentals, and by
renters to search for and reserve properties.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.0.3.

## Project Features

1. **Property listings:** Allow property owners to list their rentals and include details such as location, size, price, and available dates.
2. **Online reservations:** Allow users to browse available rentals and make reservations online, including the ability to pay for the rental through the app or website.
3. **Rental calendar:** Display a calendar showing the availability of rentals, and allow users to request specific dates.
4. **Customer\Tenants accounts:** Allow users to create and manage their own accounts, including the ability to view and update their rental history, make reservations, and pay rent.
5. **Property management:** Allow property owners to manage their listings, view reservations, and receive payments through the app or website.
6. **Communication tools:** Include tools such as messaging or chat to allow users to communicate with property owners or customer support.
7. **Payment processing:** Integrate with a payment gateway to allow users to securely pay for rentals through the app or website.
8. **Reporting and analytics:** Provide tools for tracking and analyzing data such as reservations, payments, and user behavior to help property owners make informed decisions.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
